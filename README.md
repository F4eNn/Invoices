<h2>A full-stack invoice management app where the main focus is to enable the user to:</h2>

- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Create an account
- Change credentials e.g. email or password
- Edit general info e.g. profile image, name
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode

</br>

<h2>Expected Behaviour</h2>

- Creating an invoice
  - When creating a new invoice, an ID needs to be created. Each ID should be 2 random uppercased letters followed by 4 random numbers.
  - Invoices can be created either as drafts or as pending. Clicking `Save as Draft` should allow the user to leave any form field blank, but should create an ID if one doesn't exist and set the status to `draft`. Clicking `Save & Send` should require all forms fields to be filled in, and should set the status to `pending`.
  - The `total` should be the sum of all items on the invoice.
- Editing an invoice
  - When saving changes to an invoice, all fields are required when the `Save Changes` button is clicked. If the user clicks `Cancel`, any unsaved changes should be reset.
  - If the invoice being edited is a `draft`, the status needs to be updated to "pending" when the "Save Changes" button is clicked. All fields are required at this stage.
- Menage an account
  - Validate the update form
  - Allow user to select profile photo available on device locally
- Users should be able to mark invoices as paid by clicking the `Mark as Paid` button. This should change the invoice's status to `paid`.
- See page transitions
- Users should receive a confirmation modal when trying to delete invoices.
